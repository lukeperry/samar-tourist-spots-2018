                               some slippery parts covered with moss so you have to be careful in your ascent.

                                    <div class="info"> The bridge was dedicated to Ferdinand Marcos' wife, Imelda Marcos.
                                            The Philippine government's project of the $21.9 million-dollar bridge was contracted to the
                                            Construction and Development Corporation of the Philippines (now the Philippine National 
                                            Construction Corporation), which together with Japanese engineers conducted studies and
                                            designed the actual project under the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos.
                                            Construction commenced in 1969 over San Juanico Strait from Cabalawan, Tacloban City to the
                                            municipality of Santa Rita, Samar, and was completed in 1973.
                                            Connecting Tacloban City on the Leyte side and Santa Rita town on the Samar side, the bridge 
                                            offers many picturesque views, especially of the San Juanico Strait with its thousand whirlpools 
                                            as well as the islets of the two provinces on the strait. It is approximately 10 minutes from downtown
                                            Tacloban City and is accessible by passenger jeepney, bus, motor cab or private vehicle. The bridge has
                                            43 spans and medium-size boats can pass beneath its large main arch, the top of which rises 41 meters above the sea.
